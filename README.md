## Project Title: Falcon LLM with Image-to-Text for Product Information



### Overview

This project utilizes the power of large language models (LLMs), specifically the Falcon model, to extract information from images and provide detailed product descriptions. The pipeline works as follows:



1. **Image-to-Text**: An AI model converts images into text, describing the visual content.

2. **Falcon LLM**: The extracted text is fed into the Falcon LLM, which processes the text and generates a comprehensive product description.

3. **Streamlit**: The entire process is wrapped in a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and get instant results.



### Technologies Used

- **Falcon LLM**: State-of-the-art language model for generating text.

- **Image-to-Text Model**: A pre-trained model capable of converting images to text (e.g., OpenAI CLIP, transformers, torchvision).

- **Streamlit**: Python library for building web applications.

- **Python**: Programming language for the entire project.



### Installation

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.



1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash

    python -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS

    venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat  # For Windows

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash

    pip install streamlit falcon-llm [image-to-text-model]

    ```



### Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash

    streamlit run app.py

    ```

2. Upload an image: Use the file uploader on the Streamlit app.

3. Get results: The app will display the generated product description.



### Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.

- `model.py`: Contains functions for interacting with the Falcon LLM and image-to-text model.

- `utils.py`: Helper functions for preprocessing images and text.



### Customization

- **Falcon LLM**: Experiment with different Falcon model sizes and fine-tuning.

- **Image-to-Text Model**: Choose a model that best suits your specific use case.

- **Streamlit UI**: Customize the user interface to match your preferences.



### Limitations

- **Image Quality**: The accuracy of the image-to-text model is dependent on the quality of the input image.

- **Model Limitations**: The Falcon LLM may generate incorrect or misleading information if the input text is ambiguous or contains errors.



### Future Work

- **Multilingual Support**: Extend the application to support multiple languages.

- **Product Database**: Integrate with a product database to provide more accurate and detailed information.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent the application from crashing.
